# MusicGenreClassification
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that automatically classifies a given
audio file into its respective music genre using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and
Bayes theoretic classifier with multivariate Gaussian approaches. Humans invented
musical genres as categorical designations for various types of musical works. A musical
genre is defined by the shared characteristics of its members. These qualities typically
have something to do with the musical instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic
content. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to organize the vast amounts of music
available on the Internet. Musical genre annotation is typically done by hand. Machine
learning algorithms are used to automatically predict genres. Automatic musical genre
classification can supplement or replace the human user in this process, with an accuracy
of 74% for ten musical genres using KNN and 72% for Bayes theoretic classification.
